# Speech-Recognition-System
CSE445.6 Group-6 project: A Python based speech recognition system developed as part of the CSE445 (Machine Learning) course. The project uses audio samples collected from 10 different speakers and applies ML classifiers to recognize and classify speech. The system demonstrates the effectiveness of supervised learning techniques in audio-based PR.
